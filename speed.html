        <b><p>Speed Up Your Site:<br></b>
          This is a golden rule of website building whether you’re an eco-warrior or a climate change denier – websites need to be fast to be successful. It’s a fact. And it also happens to be better for the environment, too.
          When a page is taking ages to load, it’s not only boring for your visitors – it’s also sucking up energy from the server and using electricity. So, the quicker your website loads, the less environmental impact it has.
