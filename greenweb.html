       <b><p>Find Green Web Hosting:<br></b> 
            One of the biggest culprits behind the internet’s carbon footprint is web hosting. Web hosting works by hosting a website’s files and information in data centers – all websites need hosting to appear online.
            Data centers are basically buildings that house computers storing all those websites’ data, and there are 8 million data centers worldwide.
            The problem with this is data centers use a ton of electricity, and generate a lot of heat, meaning that they rely on energy-sucking cooling systems to prevent the servers overheating. All of this adds up to data centers generating the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry!
            However, there is good news in the form of green web hosting. This is where hosting companies are committed to reducing – and even negating – their carbon footprint.
            They do this through using renewable energies to power their data centers, or donating to renewable energy programs to combat their carbon footprint.
            The best green web host is Green Geeks, which offsets its carbon footprint by 300%. </p>
