       <b> <p>Improve Your SEO<br></b>
          This section is all about making your site easily findable and satisfying users quickly. Why? Well, it reduces the amount of searches and sites people are loading in one go, which in turn reduces the amount of energy being used each time they land on a new page.
          Did you know that one Google search can generate up to seven grams of CO2? That’s about half the amount generated by boiling a kettle, which doesn’t sound so bad. Until you imagine actually boiling a kettle for every two Google searches you make in a day, and then suddenly you’re in a lot of hot water!
          Of course, you can’t reduce Google’s carbon footprint single-handedly, but you can try to give users what they’re looking for, so that they don’t have to keep searching and loading new pages over and over again. Also, it’s better for your conversions!
          To reduce the number of people bouncing off your site and back to Google:
          Prioritize key information so that it’s easy to find in as few clicks as possible
          Make your site mobile-friendly, as 60% of Google searches are carried out on mobile
          Structure your pages with headings and avoid huge walls of text, as this can scare impatient visitors away
          Improving site speed is also a massive factor in keeping people on your site, so by combining these tactics with those we talked about earlier, you’ll have a winning – and eco-friendly – combination.
